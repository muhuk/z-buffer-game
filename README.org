* What Is This?
~z-buffer-game~ is a survival/strategy game with ascii-art graphics.  It is
built using [[https://www.rust-lang.org/][Rust language]], [[https://github.com/tomassedovic/tcod-rs][tcod-rs]] as UI library and [[https://github.com/slide-rs/specs][specs]] as the
entity-component system.  It is licensed with the free license [[./LICENSE.txt][GNU GPL v3]].

** Is It Any Fun at All?
Probably, not.  At this point the main goal is to practise game development
with Rust.

** How Can I Help?
You can help by doing the following:

- Playing the game and providing feedback.
- Sharing it online to get others to play it too.

At this point there are no gamedev tasks waiting for volunteers.

* How to Play?

Currently there are no pre-compiled binaries or packages.  See [[*Development Setup][Development
Setup]] for instruction to compile and run locally.
